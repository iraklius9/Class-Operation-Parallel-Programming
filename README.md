This Python script provides a way to calculate the areas of different geometric shapes concurrently using concurrent.futures.
The supported shapes include Trapezoid, Rectangle, and Square.

Prerequisites:  Python 3.x,  Standard Python libraries (concurrent.futures, time, random)

Based on the tests, we can see that the fastest code runs using threads and the slowest using only processes
